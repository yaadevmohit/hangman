# Hangman Project

## Created using vite react-typescript

To run the cloned project from the home project directory in terminal, run following commands:
1. npm i: to install all the dependencies.
2. npm run dev: to run in developer mode

This project is from Web dev simplified project tutorial [https://youtu.be/-ONUyenGnWw] with extra added feature where 2 random letter are already guessed in the beginning to make the game slightly easier.
